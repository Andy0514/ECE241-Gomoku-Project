# ECE241-Gomoku-Project
This is the Gomoku FPGA project for ECE241 - Digital Systems course. 

Teammates: Haolin (Andy) Wang, Zichun Huang

We have created a Gomoku game on Intel FPGA using Quartus platform. Players can play against each other on a computer screen and control the cursor using a mouse. Players can even play against the computer, which is implemented as a Nios II soft-core processor and has been programmed in C.

We received top project recognition from course staff. 

You can view pictures of the project, as well as schematic diagrams, in the project report: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A9tMLwnQ9BOxLFXyLJD4qG8IPFxQRinYCNUsIeTSvfs/edit?usp=sharing
